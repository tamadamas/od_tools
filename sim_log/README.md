# Log generator for [OpenDominion Game](https://github.com/OpenDominion/OpenDominion)

Converted from the script included in sim file from [Yami-10/OD-Simulator](https://github.com/Yami-10/OD-Simulator)

# The idea
I work on Linux so don't have Excel and has no ability to generate `log.txt` from sim file.

This tool writen in [GO](https://go.dev/) can generate `log.txt` from Excel file
both local and downloaded from Google Sheet. It should work in any Operation System.

The code contains only final script generation logic. All other things left the same in Excel file.

Remember to open Excel sim before generation. ALl formulas should run and update their values with Excel.

# Get binary
You can use prebuilt binaries at [Releases](https://github.com/rxx/od_sim/releases) or build from sources with

To install `go` check [instructions here](https://go.dev/doc/install)

and then run
```
go install github.com/rxx/od_sim/app@latest
```
it installs to `GOPATH/bin` with a name `app`. (weird, huh?)

Rename it to `od_sim` or whatever you like.

Make sure `GOPATH` is visible to the system. [This guide](https://go.dev/wiki/SettingGOPATH) will help you.

# Usage
Next will work for Linux and Mac
```
od_sim generate_log -sim OpenDominionSim.xlsm -result sim.txt
```

For windows you can also run `od_sim` from terminal or put command line to the exe options.

I don't have Windows and can't test and describe the actual process, it would be helpfull if someone describe that and make a pull request ^_^
