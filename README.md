# Log generator for [OpenDominion Game](https://github.com/OpenDominion/OpenDominion)

Converted from the script included in sim file from [Yami-10/OD-Simulator](https://github.com/Yami-10/OD-Simulator)

# The idea

I work on Linux so don't have Excel and has no ability to generate `log.txt` from sim file.

This tool can generate `log.txt` from Excel file and should work in any Operation System.

The code contains only final script generation logic. All other things left the same in Excel file.

Remember to open Excel sim before generation. ALl formulas should run and update their values with Excel.

# Usage

Next will work for Linux and Mac

```
sim generate_log -sim OpenDominionSim.xlsm -result sim.txt
```

Get file from [Yami-10/OD-Simulator](https://github.com/Yami-10/OD-Simulator)
